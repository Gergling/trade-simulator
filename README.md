## Installation

Strap in because installing everything without docker is going to be fun, for a given definition of the word 'fun'.

You will need:

* Postgres
* Python
* NPM

When you've eventually done that, take a shot and do the following:

* (in windows) cmd.bat - this will open a command line of reasonable size, instead of those silly little things windows has by default. It will give you a command line prompt for the following:
* (in linux) open a command line and cd to your project directory
* (in windows) install.bat
