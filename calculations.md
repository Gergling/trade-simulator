# Happiness

Has a 'need' multiplier which maxes out at 1.
Need is calculated based on survivability.
If node runs out of resources, deaths are calculated somehow
Deaths decrease survivability rating
Physiology is somewhat elastic and uniform, so lower consumption levels can occur for things like food when forced.
Below a certain basic level, people die of starvation.
Consumption reduces with lower population, so death rates theoretically decrease, but there are fewer to produce food,
so import is a major factor.
